## Overview
The JavaScript Challenges serve as a documentation of my journey in web development â€” from basic HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript to various frameworks like React and Vue. Admittedly, some challenges may lack responsiveness, and certain pieces of code might not be optimal. Nonetheless, these challenges provided invaluable opportunities to refine my coding skills. Explore these challenges and feel free to take them on! During the creation of this showcase, I used Nuxt.js and created scroll animations and smooth page transitions with GSAP and Lenis Library.
